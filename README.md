# 🚀 ParrotOS Configuration Files

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to my ParrotOS setup - the digital lair where I make computers bend to my will. Think of this as my digital fingerprint, but way cooler and with more keyboard shortcuts.

## 🎯 What's This All About?

So I finally organized my ParrotOS config files because:
- My previous setup was held together by digital duct tape and prayers
- I got tired of setting everything up from scratch every time
- You can never have too many custom keybindings (fight me)

## 🗂️ What's in the Box?

| Directory | Purpose | Cool Factor |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `bspwm/` | Window Manager | 🪟 Makes windows dance to my tune |
| `kitty/` | Terminal | 🐱 Because cool hackers use cool terminals |
| `nvim/` | Text Editor | ✨ Vim but on steroids (Lua powered!) |
| `polybar/` | Status Bar | 📊 Shows all the important stuff at a glance |
| `rofi/` | App Launcher | 🚀 Because clicking is for peasants |
| `scripts/` | Custom Scripts | ⚡ The secret sauce that makes everything tick |

## 🎮 The Scripts That Make Me Look Cool

### 🔊 `volume.sh`
- Controls system volume like a DJ
- Because dragging sliders is too mainstream
- Includes fancy notifications that make you feel important

### 🔋 `battery_alert.sh`
- Yells at me when my battery is dying
- Prevents sudden laptop death during important moments
- Basically my digital survival instinct

### 📡 `wifi_toggle.sh` & `wifi_ap_scripts/`
- WiFi manipulation on steroids
- Turns my laptop into a hotspot when needed
- Makes me feel like a networking wizard

## 🛠️ Installation (For the Brave)

```bash
# Clone this repository like a pro
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/parrotos-config.git
cd parrotos-config

# The magic happens here
./install.sh  # (Coming soon to a terminal near you)
```

Or if you're old school:

```bash
# Manual mode - for those who like to live dangerously
cp -r bspwm/ ~/.config/
cp -r kitty/ ~/.config/
cp -r nvim/ ~/.config/
cp -r polybar/ ~/.config/
cp -r rofi/ ~/.config/
cp -r scripts/ ~/.config/
```

## 🎨 The Philosophy

> "Your computer should work for you, not the other way around"

This setup is built on three principles:
1. **Efficiency**: Everything is a keybind away
2. **Aesthetics**: If it doesn't look cool, why bother?
3. **Functionality**: It actually has to work (most of the time)

## 🚀 Features That Make Me Smile

- **Tiling Windows**: Because overlapping windows are so 2005
- **Custom Keybinds**: Super + Everything = Magic
- **Themes**: Dark mode everything (my eyes thank me)
- **Scripts**: Automating the boring stuff since forever

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This configuration:
- May cause extreme productivity
- Could make other operating systems seem boring
- Might result in you spending hours customizing instead of working
- Has been known to attract "oohs" and "aahs" from fellow nerds

## 🎯 Pro Tips

1. **Backup First**: Don't be that person who loses everything
2. **Read the Scripts**: Know what you're running (or don't, I'm not your mom)
3. **Customize**: Make it yours - that's the whole point!
4. **Break Things**: That's how you learn (just have backups)

## 🤝 Contributing

Found a bug? Have a cool improvement? 
- Open an issue (I promise I'll look at it eventually)
- Submit a PR (if you can make it through my picky code review)
- Or just tell me what's broken (politely, please)

## 📞 Support

If something breaks:
1. Check the logs
2. Google it
3. Panic
4. Open an issue

Just kidding about step 3. Mostly.
